'''1. Modules:

In Python, a module is a single file containing Python definitions, functions, classes, or variables. It acts as a container for organizing related code. Modules allow you to break down a large application into smaller, manageable files, making code easier to maintain and understand.

Creating a Module:

To create a module, you need to write your Python code in a separate file with a .py extension. For example, let's create a module named math_operations.py:
# math_operations.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
Using a Module:

To use the functions defined in the math_operations module, you first need to import it into your Python script. This can be achieved using the import keyword:
import math_operations

result_add = math_operations.add(5, 3)
result_subtract = math_operations.subtract(10, 4)

print("Addition:", result_add)  # Output: Addition: 8
print("Subtraction:", result_subtract)  # Output: Subtraction: 6
2. Packages:

While modules are useful for organizing code within a single file, packages take the concept further by allowing you to organize modules in directories and subdirectories. A package is a collection of modules that work together to provide a specific functionality or feature set. It helps maintain a hierarchical structure for your code, enhancing readability and reducing naming conflicts.

Creating a Package:

To create a package, you need to organize related modules in a directory and include a special file called __init__.py within that directory. This file can be empty or contain Python code. Let's create a package named geometry:
geometry/
    __init__.py
    shapes.py
    measurements.py
# math_operations.py

def add(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Returns the difference between two numbers."""
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of two numbers."""
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    """
    Returns the division result of two numbers.
    Raises a ValueError if the second number (b) is zero.
    """
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b

# main.py
import math_operations

# Using the add function
result_add = math_operations.add(5, 3)
print("Addition:", result_add)  # Output: Addition: 8

# Using the subtract function
result_subtract = math_operations.subtract(10, 4)
print("Subtraction:", result_subtract)  # Output: Subtraction: 6

# Using the multiply function
result_multiply = math_operations.multiply(6, 7)
print("Multiplication:", result_multiply)  # Output: Multiplication: 42

# Using the divide function
try:
    result_divide = math_operations.divide(10, 2)
    print("Division:", result_divide)  # Output: Division: 5.0
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

# Attempting to divide by zero
try:
    result_divide_zero = math_operations.divide(7, 0)
    print("Division:", result_divide_zero)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
In the main.py script, we import the math_operations module using import math_operations. Then, we use the functions from the module to perform basic mathematical operations. The try-except blocks are used to handle potential ValueError exceptions raised when attempting to divide by zero.

To run this code, save both the math_operations.py and main.py files in the same directory and execute main.py. You should see the output demonstrating the usage of the functions from the math_operations module.
Package: requests

Purpose and Functionality:

The requests library is a popular third-party package for making HTTP requests in Python. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP/1.1 requests and handling responses, making it easy to interact with web APIs and perform various web-related tasks. Whether you need to fetch data from a RESTful API, download files, or submit forms on a website, requests provides a user-friendly interface for all these operations.
Installation:

To install the requests package, you can use pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

Package: requests

Whether you need to fetch data from a RESTful API, download files, or submit forms on a website, requests provides a user-friendly interface for all these operations.

Features of requests:

Simple API: The requests package offers an intuitive and straightforward API, making it easy for developers to send HTTP requests without worrying about low-level implementation details.

HTTP Verbs Support: It supports all common HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and more, allowing you to interact with web services effectively.

Custom Headers and Parameters: You can set custom headers, query parameters, cookies, and authentication credentials in your requests.

Response Handling: The library provides easy access to the response data, headers, and status codes, allowing you to process the server's responses efficiently.

Session Management: It supports sessions, enabling you to persist cookies across multiple requests, which is useful for maintaining user sessions on websites.

Installation:

To install the requests package, you can use pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

Copy code
pip install requests
Usage:

Once you have requests installed, you can start using it in your Python projects. Here's a simple example of how to make a GET request and handle the response:'''
